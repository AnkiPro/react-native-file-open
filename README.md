## Installation

```sh
yarn add @ankipro/react-native-file-open
```

```sh
npx pod-install
```

Sorry but, you need to modify your `ios/AppDelegate.m`.
At the top of the file, import the RNFileOpen right before '@implementation AppDelegate':

```C#
@import RNFileOpen;
```
Within your existing didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method, add the following method:

```C#
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

  // Add me --- \/
  NSURL *_Nullable launchURL = [launchOptions valueForKey:UIApplicationLaunchOptionsURLKey];
  if (launchURL) {
    [[FileOpeningModule sharedInstance] markFileOpened:launchURL];
  }
  // Add me --- /\

  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}
```
At the end of the file add the following:
```C#
// Add me --- \/
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
            openURL:(NSURL *)url
            options:(nonnull NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey, id> *)options
{
  [[FileOpeningModule sharedInstance] markFileOpened:url];
  return YES;
}
// Add me --- /\

@end
```

If you want the app to appear in suggestions when you open certain files on your device, you need to add the desired extensions in the project info.

For example adding `.zip` extension looks like:

## Basic usage

```ts
import FileOpening from '@ankipro/react-native-file-open';

// ...

 useEffect(() => {
    const onFileOpened = (uri: string) => {
      console.log('Opened file: ', uri);
    };

    FileOpening.getOpenedFileURL().then(onFileOpened).catch(() => {});

    const subscription = FileOpening.addListener((data) => {
      onFileOpened(data.url);
    });

    return () => {
      subscription.remove();
    };
  }, []);
```
